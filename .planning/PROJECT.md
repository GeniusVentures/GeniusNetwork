# GNUS Child Wallet

## What This Is

Child wallets (subwallets) for the GNUS SuperGenius node. Games integrating the GNUS SDK operate independent child wallets that can earn GNUS, hold and transfer assets, and optionally register a main wallet — without ever exposing the main wallet's private key.

## Core Value

The main wallet must be able to discover, monitor, and manage registered child wallets through consensus-visible state — every child-wallet behavior maps onto concrete SuperGenius anchor points (GeniusAccount, TransactionManager, CRDT/GlobalDB, PubSubBroadcasterExt, consensus validation).

## Current Milestone: v2.1 Main Wallet Child Balance Query

**Goal:** Allow the main wallet to query a registered child wallet's child token balance from its synced CRDT data, following the same UTXO summation pattern used for its own balance.

**Target features:**
- `GeniusNode::GetChildBalance(child_address, token_id)` wrapping existing `UTXOManager::GetBalance(token_id, address)`
- Child token balance computed from synced CRDT UTXOs (no gRPC/SDK in this phase)
- Multi-node integration test: child registers, receives funds, main queries child balance via CRDT

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ Child-wallet identity model (emergent identity, independent keypair) — v2.0
- ✓ RegistrationTransaction — proto schema, C++ class, CRDT filter with 4 gates — v2.0
- ✓ Registration sequence numbering and monotonicity enforcement — v2.0
- ✓ PubSub broadcast and CRDT sync (reg/ namespace, D-49 RegElementCallback) — v2.0
- ✓ GetRegistrationsForMain — scans reg/ CRDT and returns discovered children — v2.0

### Active

- [ ] Main wallet queries child token balance from synced CRDT UTXOs
- [ ] Integration test validates balance query after registration + funding

### Out of Scope

- gRPC/SDK balance API — node-internal only this milestone; API layer deferred
- Full monitoring dashboard (DISC-02: all assets, activity, escrow status) — deferred
- Multi-token balance — child token only, matching DevConfig TokenID
- Balance display formatting (FormatTokens/ConvertToChildToken) — deferred to API phase

## Context

- v1.0 shipped implementation-ready design documents covering identity, registration, CRDT/registry, pubsub sync, consensus authority, discovery/monitoring, and reward policy
- v2.0 implemented the first slice: child-signed registration with CRDT persistence, pubsub broadcast, and multi-node integration tests
- The main node already subscribes to child pubsub topics via D-49 RegElementCallback and syncs the child's CRDT deltas — the UTXO data is already present locally
- The existing `GeniusNode::GetBalance(token_id, address)` → `UTXOManager::GetBalance(token_id, address)` pattern sums UTXOs filtered by address and token ID — the same mechanism can target a child address

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: C++17/C++20, CMake, Boost.Asio, libp2p, Protocol Buffers — must match existing SuperGenius conventions
- **Coding standard**: Corelinux-derived C++ style — Ullman braces, PascalCase types, `m_`/trailing-underscore member prefix
- **Compatibility**: Must not break existing SuperGenius, GeniusSDK, or GeniusWallet builds
- **Security**: Main-wallet private key must never enter the child process; child balance is read-only from consensus-visible state
- **Serialization**: No new proto messages needed this milestone — balance is computed in-memory from existing UTXO data

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Emergent child identity (D-01) | Child-ness derived from registration record, not creation-time flag | ✓ Good |
| Child-signed-only registration (D-04/D-05) | Main does not counter-sign; compromise bounded to child | ✓ Good |
| RegistrationTx as first-class transaction (D-06) | Reuses TransactionManager path identically to TransferTx | ✓ Good |
| CRDT reg/ namespace (D-11/D-12) | Registration records in `/bc-{net}/reg/{child_addr}`, not `tx/` | ✓ Good |
| D-49 main follows child's pubsub | RegElementCallback subscribes on reg/ delta arrival | ✓ Good |
| Balance from synced CRDT (this milestone) | No direct query; use UTXOManager on locally-synced data | — Pending |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd-transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd-complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
