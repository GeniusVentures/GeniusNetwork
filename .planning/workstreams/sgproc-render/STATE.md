# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-29), workstream section "Workstream: sgproc-render"

**Core value:** Make SGProcessingManager's `render` PassType a real, executable graphics pipeline via hand-rolled Vulkan — headless/offscreen, own independent `VkInstance`/`VkDevice`, no new GPU backend/engine, no OpenGL or CPU/software fallback tier.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — Vulkan Foundation & Dispatch Plumbing

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (Vulkan Foundation & Dispatch Plumbing) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 6
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-07-29 — Phase 01 execution started

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table (root project). Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Restart: hand-rolled Vulkan replaces the archived bgfx-based v1.0 attempt, which violated SGProcessingManager#7's "no new GPU backend, no duplicate platform setup" constraint (2026-07-29)
- Research reconciled: shared process-wide Vulkan init-lock (treating MNN's existing `mnn_vulkan_mutex` as stronger evidence than spec-only reasoning) — see research/SUMMARY.md Decision Flag #1
- Research reconciled: `shaderc` chosen over bare `glslang` for GLSL→SPIR-V, since `spirv-val`/SPIRV-Tools validation is mandatory regardless and shaderc bundles it — see research/SUMMARY.md Decision Flag #2
- Roadmap: Phase 2 (schema/shader validation) is independently developable and could run parallel to Phase 1 (Vulkan context); sequenced after Phase 1 for planning clarity only, not a hard dependency
- Roadmap: Dispatch plumbing (originally a separate research-suggested phase) folded into Phase 1 rather than standing alone — small/mechanical, no independent user-observable value on its own, and no hard ordering dependency on the rest of context setup
- [Phase 01-02]: D-01 resolved: adopt vk-bootstrap (charles-lunarg/vk-bootstrap, MIT), pinned at v1.4.357 — Confirmed live by orchestrating agent per auto_advance/yolo config; macOS/MoltenVK portability-subset risk outweighs zero-net-new-vendoring preference

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Decision Flag #1 (Vulkan init synchronization) is not fully closed by research alone — Phase 1 must validate via an actual concurrent-init stress test, not assume the shared-lock design is correct from reasoning alone
- Decision Flag #2 (shaderc vs. glslang) is reconciled toward shaderc but should be explicitly confirmed during Phase 2 planning
- CI currently has zero real-GPU or software-Vulkan-ICD signal, and zero macOS CI signal for Vulkan at all — Phase 4 must resolve this, not assume it away
